First, you need to understand who you are. Learn about yourself and jobs you'll suit with the About Me tool.

Work through the questions, and we’ll begin to build a picture of your personality. Can’t see the exact right choice? Go with the one that’s closest to you.

Your results will reveal your three strongest character traits, and suggest jobs to match the kind of person you are.

Remember, if you have a My World of Work account, we'll save your results so you've got them handy for future job, university and college applications.

You can also try our Strengths and Skills Explorer tools. The more tools you complete, the better career suggestions we can give.

Ready to go? It won't even take five minutes </p>
